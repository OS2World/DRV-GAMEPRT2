GAMEPRT2.SYS is an OS2 joystick interface driver.
It is an updated version of GAMEPORT.SYS.

--------------------
Installation:
1)Insert GAMEPRT2.SYS in your OS2 directory.
2)If you already have GAMEPORT.SYS installed, please change the
  CONFIG.SYS file so that the line which has:
  DEVICE=C:\OS2\GAMEPORT.SYS
  ...is changed to...
  DEVICE=C:\OS2\GAMEPRT2.SYS
3)If you do not have GAMEPORT.SYS installed, then insert
  DEVICE=C:\OS2\GAMEPRT2.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file, where C is
  likely the drive where your OS2 directory is found.
4)Add command line options if required, for example:
  DEVICE=C:\OS2\GAMEPRT2.SYS			<--default value
  or
  DEVICE=C:\OS2\GAMEPRT2.SYS /VB /P:201 /W:7D0	<--also default

Where:
  /VB displays the gameport header at startup.
  /P:hhhh is the joystick port (hhhh=hex address of port)
  /W:hhhh is the wait run-a-way counter (hhhh=waiting time).

The joystick port is unlikely to be found at another location,
so the /P:201 is set as the default value.

The /W option may come in useful if you run a very fast computer
and find that the joystick can't be found.

If you can't find the joystick, I recommend increasing the value
of /W:hhhh a little at a time, don't put a large value like
/W:FFFF since you may find your computer running very slow.

For myself 7D0 as per the original program is more than adequate
since I get maximum values of 172 (so in my case I would want to
drop the value down to /W:1BC so that my machine doesn't sit idle
in the gameport polling loop).

If you want to set the /W option, then run JOY_PORT.EXE and move
your joystick back-n-forth to see what values come back. Then add
something like 10%-20% to the value as a safety margin to make sure
the joystick is read every time. For example, my gamepad gives a
maximum of 172, so /W:1BC is a good value.

GAMEPORT.SYS by Frank Ivan, ICA Systems Group
See GAMEPT.ZIP for original GAMEPORT.SYS joystick driver

GAMEPRT2.SYS by Jose DaSilva, Vancouver, BC, Canada
based on GAMEPORT.SYS driver

GAMEPRT2.DOC = This file
GAMEPRT2.SYS = OS2 joystick device driver
GAMEPRT2.ASM = Updated version of GAMEPORT.ASM
GAMEPRT2.BAT = DOS batch file to create GAMEPRT2.SYS
JOY_PORT.EXE = Test program for GAMEPORT.SYS or GAMEPRT2.SYS
JOY_PORT.CPP = Example source code for JOY_PORT.EXE

Compatibility Chart:

IBM, ver2.0			Jose Da Silva

This chart lets you know that GAMEPRT2.SYS is compatible to
GAMEPORT.SYS, but not with the standard gameport driver
written by IBM named GAMEDD.SYS and GAMEVDD.SYS

GAMEDD.SYS located within GAMEDD2.ZIP is compatible with
GAMEPORT.SYS, GAMEPRT2.SYS and IBM's GAMEDD.SYS so if you
are running a machine better than a 80286, you may decide
to use the updated GAMEDD.SYS instead.

--------------------
History:
Jul 01,2000 1.2 update and add gameprt2.asm, Joy_Port.cpp
Jun 25,2000	Created Joy_Port.cpp to test GAMEPRT2.SYS
Jun 07,2000	Added compatibility chart to documentation
Dec 11,1999 1.1 Initial version 1.10 of GAMEPRT2.SYS

Have fun and enjoy
